                                                 Mythtv Script Detail Instructions

I will add screenshots

  There are two bash scripts that need to be modified and installed.

Prerequisites:

Fundamental Prerequisites:

Mavericks (OSX) and beyond ..installed and working

System that can handle transcoding a large HD or SD TV recording in an acceptable time.
  For example,  a 2012 Mac Mini i7 2.3 GHZ can transcode a HD TV show in about the same time that the recording takes.  This system can still handle a recording and watching a show while this is happening.

  You will have to consider when and how you want to start these scripts depending on your system and view needs.


Mythtv installed and working

I would recommend Macports for Mythtv but other methods that are simpler are fine as well:

MacPorts for Mythtv

https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MacPorts

There is a download or build section....  this is key of whether you want to install Mythtv and build it on your system  or download a pre-built system

Installing the Mythtv backend and front end (in my opinion) is complicated.  Good luck.

Please configure your mythtv to be able to record a TV show.

I would recommend installing Mythweb to use a web based interface for scheduling and controlling your recordings

https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythWeb

This is also a complicated process but well worth it (but is optional)



Handbrake

The point of Handbrake is transcoding a mpegts file that is recorded by mythtv to a format that is compatible with your devices (along with it being smaller)

Please install Handbrake and Handbrake CLI

https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php
   (Download the Mac 64 bit version) for the GUI version
   Also, go to the other category and go to the screen to download the CLI (Command line Interface) version for the MAC

Please use Handbrake (GUI) first and try to transcode a file that you want to convert
  Please read how Handbrake works via documentation on website
  I would focus on the presets available...

Repeat the process by opening a terminal session via the terminal app  (Typicallyfound in Application under Utilities)

https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CLIGuide

This link will explain how to use the command line interface for Handbrake.   I would focus on the presets.

For the scripts,  I am using the AppleTV 3 preset.   I find the quality is fine for playback from a large HD Plasma screen to an iPhone.


The script -  mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh  uses the handbrake cli to do the transcode process and trying handbrake along will help with the installation process


Mythtv-Comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh

this is a bash script that you will need to edit and create as an executable script


You can use Xcode, TextWrangler or any script friendly editor

1) Download the two scripts   mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh to a safe place  (desktop, documents, etc)
2) Using the terminal app,  you will want to copy these files to working directory for testing


For Mythtv,  you should have created Storage Directories

  see https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythTV-HOWTO   for everything on howto's

In the script default set is

/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/default

So, in the setup for these scripts the following are assumed

TV Recordings are in  /volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/default

TV Recordings are moved from this default location to a separate directory for transcoding

this scripts directory for the transcode is..   /volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode

You can change the scripts to whatever directory structure you want...

I would recommend to put the scripts in the transcode directory and test them out from there...


3)  Create the transcode directory

in a terminal window,  mkdir PATHYOUWANTFORTRANSCODEDIRECTORY

example   mkdir "/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode"

4) Go to that directory

in a terminal window,  cd PATHYOUWANTFORTRANSCODEDIRECTORY

example   cd "/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode"


5)copy scripts to the transcode directory initially for debug and testing

 Use finder and copy and paste the file from your download location to the transcode directory for both scripts
 or

in a terminal window,  cp  PATHOFDOWNLOAD/*.sh  PATHYOUWANTFORTRANSCODEDIRECTORY

example   cp ~Home/mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh "/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode/"



6) using an editor  (textwrangler, Xcode) ,  you will want to change the source and destination locations

For the script -  mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh

Update the following areas..

MYTHREC_DIR is the storage location where you are saving your tv shows..
MYTHTRANSCODE_DIR is the new directory you just created in Step (3) above
HANDBRAKE_DIR is the directory where you have Handbrake CLI saved

MYTHREC_DIR="/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/default"
MYTHTRANSCODE_DIR="/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode"
HANDBRAKE_DIR=/Applications


save the file


7) you will need to make this an executable script

so in the transcode directory,   you will want to do a ls command

in a terminal window,  ls -lt

you should see the two script files

in a terminal window,  mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh

if you don't have permissions,  use sudo mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom.sh
you will be prompted for your password...

now you have an edited and installed script..


8) make sure that you have a TV recording to transcode ...

Go to the directory where your TV recordings are.....check you STORAGE DIRECTORY settings

In this script case,  that is the default location  ... volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/default

in a terminal window,  cd PATHWHEREYOURRECORDINGSARE

eg.   cd "/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/default"


find the recording

in a terminal window in the recording directory,  ls -lt *.mpg

you should see some file(s) that are your recordings..


They have the format   chanid_startutcdatetime.mpg

eg    1780_2015011920000.mpg

1780 ..channel is 1+Real channel  = 1+780 ...1780
2015011920000 .. 2015 is the yes  0119 is the date 20000 is 20th hr of the day (UTC/GMT= Greenwich Time)

write down or you can copy the long file name by selecting the name with your cursor from the ls -lt command in the terminal window

go back to the transcode directory

in a terminal window in the recording directory,  cd PATHYOUWANTFORTRANSCODEDIRECTORY

eg cd ""/volumes/macintosh\ HD\ 2/Mythtv/transcode"


9)  Now you are going to try out your script to see if it works...

in a terminal window in the transcoding directory,

mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom chanid starttime

eg..mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom 1780 2015011920000

note: you have to have a space and not an underscore between the chanid and starttime

if you don't have permission,  sudo mythtv-comm-removal-x264-noautom 1780 2015011920000




Testing of the script....
